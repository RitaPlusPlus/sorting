### Variant 3: Sorting algorithms (Team 3)

Using C++ programming language and Qt framework implement a software project that represents a graphical user interface (GUI) based sorting algorithms demonstration and performance analysis software. The software must support the following functionalities:

- it must allow the input and sort of sequences of any length of the following basic data types: integers, floating-point numbers, strings;
- the software must implement and use the following sorting algorithms: selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort;
- it can visualize the stages of each algorithm step-by-step;
- it measures the execution time of each algorithm for various number of elements of the input sequence;
- it displays the execution time of each algorithm for different input length of the sequence and allows visually to compare the complexity of the algorithms.

The program must have the following features:

- GUI to input sequence or to generate a random sequence;
- GUI to read and store sequences from and to files;
- GUI to demonstrate the execution of a given algorithm step-by-step;
- GUI to show complexity of algorithms and compare them.

# Tasks
- **GUI** Input/Generate sequence /in/
- Implement the data structure to hold the sequence /rr/
- **GUI** Implement Read/Write in files.
  - Read /tk/
  - Write /at/
- Implement sorting algorithms:
  - selection sort + measure execution time /tk/
  - insertion sort + measure execution time /at/
  - bubble sort + measure execution time /rr/
  - merge sort + measure execution time /in/
  - quick sort /rr/
- **GUI** Display the measured time of each algorithm /at/
- **GUI** Visually compare the complexity /tk/
